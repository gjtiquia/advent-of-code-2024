# Advent of Code 2024

"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like." - Eric Wastl (Advent Of Code)

This repository is my attempt at the Advent of Code 2024 with C++

## Commands

`bash build.sh` : Compile `main.cpp` into an executable called `main`
`./main` : Run `main` executable
